# Forensics Category:

### Portugal :

# Description :

> I accidentally left my computer unlocked at the coffee shop while I stepped away. I'm sure that someone took advantage of the opportunity and was searching for something.

In this challenge, we have a memory dump. The challenge description says "was searching for something."

Using Volatility 2, we find the chrome.exe process, so let's check the Chrome history.

I used a Volatility 2 plugin from [superponiblog](https://blog.superponible.com/2014/08/31/volatility-plugin-chrome-history/)

We can see the flag in parts, so let's arrange them.

FLAG : 
> AKASEC{V0L4T1L1TY_f0r_chr0m3_s34rch_h1st0ry}

### Sussy :

In this challenge, we have a pcap file. Basic analysis reveals some suspicious requests.

Decoding the first subdomain from hex, we find a 7z extension.

![](https://github.com/d33znu75/AKASEC-CTF-2024-challenges/raw/main/images/ex2.png)

Let's retrieve that zip file by extracting it from the DNS traffic:

```tshark -T fields -e dns.qry.name -r packet.pcapng | grep akasec.ma | uniq | sed 's/.akasec.ma//' | tr -d '\n'```

![](https://github.com/d33znu75/AKASEC-CTF-2024-challenges/raw/main/images/ex3.png)

We discover that the 7z file is password-protected, so let's crack it with John the Ripper.

After extracting the zip, we find another password-protected PDF. Let's crack it using `pdfcracker`.

FLAG : 
> AKASEC{PC4P_DNS_3xf1ltr4t10n_D0n3!!}

### Sharing is not Caring :

# Description :

> My friends and I use the same computer on campus and have a shared folder to exchange files. After submitting the flag for the challenge, it was leaked, and someone obtained it without my knowledge. I'm unsure how they got it.

> Author : d33znu75

> Attachments : [network.pcapng](https://www.mediafire.com/file/kbml0x3rrjqkwlx/network.pcapng/file) , [disk.ad1](https://www.mediafire.com/file/hn4m2hufc0jzf3a/disk.ad1/file)

Analyzing the pcap file, we find that the user visited two websites:

    1 - A website with a download link for malware.
    2 - A flag submission website.

![](https://github.com/d33znu75/AKASEC-CTF-2024-challenges/raw/main/images/mal1.png)

After downloading the malware and analyzing it, we use two methods:

First, we use the strings command on the file to reveal the PowerShell code.

![](https://github.com/d33znu75/AKASEC-CTF-2024-challenges/raw/main/images/mal2.png)

Alternatively, VirusTotal shows that the malware drops an `sslkey.log` file in `C:\`.

Decoding the PowerShell script, we obtain:

Next, let's look for the file in the `.ad1` image using FTK Imager.

After extracting it, we decrypt the traffic to retrieve the flag.

FLAG : 
> AKASEC{B4s1c_M4lw4r3_4nd_PC4P_4n4lys1s}

# Steganography Category:

### Matry-Steg-oshka :

# Description :

> I hope you do not get a headache.

> Author : d33znu75

> Hints :
>   "when you hear "the flag is" next part is corrupted, no noise reduction but you can see the flag ðŸ˜˜"
>   "this is a steganography challenege. in the voice audio, the flag hidden in the corrupted part and you must SEE it (it is the reason why it is corrupted). switch it, a tool is needed."

> Attachment : [National_Anthem_of_Palestine.wav](https://www.mediafire.com/file/fp0141309t0y1kh/National_Anthem_of_Palestine.wav/file)

In this challenge, we have an audio WAV file. By opening it with any spectrum analyzer, we find some words at the end of the audio.

![](https://github.com/d33znu75/AKASEC-CTF-2024-challenges/raw/main/images/steg1.png)

Using CFMVSUJD, we extract a file with steghide.

![](https://github.com/d33znu75/AKASEC-CTF-2024-challenges/raw/main/images/steg2.png)

Opening the file with a hex editor, we see that every 16 bytes are reversed. 

![](https://github.com/d33znu75/AKASEC-CTF-2024-challenges/raw/main/images/stegrev.png)

Let's run a Python script to fix that.

```py
import sys

def reverse_chunks(file_path, chunk_size=16):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        data = f.read()
    
    reversed_data = bytearray()
    
    for i in range(0, len(data), chunk_size):
        chunk = data[i:i+chunk_size]
        reversed_data.extend(chunk[::-1])
    
    output_path = file_path.replace('.wav', '_reversed.wav')
    with open(output_path, 'wb') as f:
        f.write(reversed_data)
    
    print(f"Reversed file saved as {output_path}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print("Usage: python reverse_wav.py <file_path>")
    else:
        reverse_chunks(sys.argv[1])
```

We received another audio file of a woman speaking, but there is some noise. The hint says that "we must see it." By converting the WAV file to a PNG using [wav2png](https://directmusic.me/wav2png/), we can see the flag.
